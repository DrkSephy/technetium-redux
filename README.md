# technetium-redux

## Project Setup

This project is written using the [latest version of node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which supports ES6 natively. Installing node.js will also install the `npm` package manager. Once you have this, simply run the following command in the root directory of this project: 

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all of the dependencies listed within `package.json`. 

> Mac OS X users will need to run `sudo npm install`. 

`gulp` is used for building the project, which can be installed by doing:

```bash
npm install gulp
```

> Mac OS X users will need to run `sudo npm install gulp`.

Next, [download mongodb](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads#production).

Lastly, create a file `secrets.js` in the root directory which contains the following information:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  database: 'localhost', // Setup MongoDB connection url
  consumerKey: '', // Bitbucket Consumer Key
  consumerSecret: '' // Bitbucket Consumer Secret
}
```

Obtaining a `consumer key` and `consumer secret` can be done by following the OAuth 2.0 steps [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud-238027431.html). 

> **NOTE**: `secrets.js` is a file which is ignored by gitignore, so this file will never be pushed into your repository unless done by force. 

## Running the project

Once all of these pre-requisites have been installed, open three different terminal tabs. In each tab, run the following commands:

```bash
gulp
```

This will build all the necessary files, and watch for any file changes.

```bash
npm run watch
```

This will run the development server, which will watch for any file changes and re-compile all source files. 

```bash
mongod
```

This will start a MongoDB instance, which our application will connect to. 

With this, the application can be used by navigating to `localhost:3000`.
